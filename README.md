# DNP3 Monitor

A DNP3 device monitoring system built with Python, FastAPI, SQLite, Docker, and Grafana.

## Overview

This project simulates a DNP3 master station that continuously polls outstations, collects measurements, and displays them on a real-time dashboard. It demonstrates the integration of industrial automation protocols with modern software development practices.

## Architecture
```
DNP3 Outstation (simulated)
        ↓
Collector (Python)     ← polls devices every 10 seconds
        ↓
SQLite Database        ← stores measurements
        ↓
FastAPI REST API       ← exposes data via HTTP
        ↓
Grafana Dashboard      ← visualizes live data
```

## Features

- REST API with full device and measurement management
- Automatic polling of DNP3 devices every 10 seconds
- Support for Analog Inputs, Binary Inputs and Double-bit Inputs
- Persistent SQLite database with Docker volumes
- Real-time Grafana dashboard with organized tables per point type
- Multi-container setup with Docker Compose
- Simulated DNP3 outstation for testing without real hardware

## Tech Stack

- **Python 3.10** — collector and API
- **FastAPI** — REST API framework
- **SQLAlchemy** — ORM for database operations
- **SQLite** — lightweight database
- **Docker + Docker Compose** — containerization
- **Grafana** — real-time dashboard
- **dnp3-python** — DNP3 protocol binding (simulation mode)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose

### Run the project
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/dnp3-monitor.git
cd dnp3-monitor
docker compose up -d
```

### Register a device
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/devices \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Subestacao Norte",
    "host": "192.168.1.10",
    "port": 20000,
    "dnp3_address": 1,
    "active": true,
    "analog_input_count": 10,
    "binary_input_count": 8,
    "double_point_count": 4
  }'
```
